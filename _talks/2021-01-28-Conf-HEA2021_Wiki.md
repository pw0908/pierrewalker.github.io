Wikis can facilitate an effective and increased online engagement between individuals who may be geographically distributed. In January 2020, a student-led Chemical Engineering Wiki was developed by two undergraduate students at Imperial College with progressive support from staff. Wiki pages were developed for ten second-year modules which by June 2020 had received over 10,000 views. 90% of the students who used the Wiki found it to be a valuable means of retrieving information, consolidating concepts and preparing for their examinations. These efforts will continue across all year groups in the new academic year and it is hoped that this will provide students additional opportunities for increased collaboration and peer scaffolding given the ongoing requirements for remote teaching and learning.
