The implementation of thermodynamic equations of state for physical property prediction (density, heat capacity, enthalpy, phase fractions, etc) is traditionally an esoteric process. With Juliaâ€™s clean syntax and efficient multiple-dispatch system, it is possible to produce extremely lucid code without trade-offs in efficiency, while also being infinitely extensible. We hope to show that Julia is a powerful tool that can transform the art of thermodynamic modelling in both academia and industry.
