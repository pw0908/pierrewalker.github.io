Embedding and managing independent learning within Engineering curricula can be somewhat challenging. This work explores the value of student-led projects towards facilitating independent learning by examining the experiences of undergraduate Engineering students who have been involved in two small-scale projects. The first involves creating a student-led maker space to develop a working prototype of a 3D-printed separation column while the second focuses on the role of students as partners in module design. The results show that these student-led initiatives can provide rewarding independent learning situations that build leadership and resilience, encourage entrepreneurship, promote life-long learning and increase selfefficacy and motivation.
