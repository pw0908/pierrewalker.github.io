Teaching computer-aided design (CAD) software within the Chemical Engineering Department at Imperial College is somewhat limited by a condensed timetable and traditionally, students will produce 2D hand-drawn diagrams as part of their module requirements. With the move to remote teaching, students and staff collaborated on a series of online CAD training videos and exercises which were trialled for nine students before being rolled out to the entire third-year cohort. Initial feedback showed that the students found the CAD training to be helpful and relevant to not only the current module, but also to other design-based modules within their programme. This highlights the importance of staff-student collaborations and embedding the student voice to create more authentic learning experiences.

Speakers: Nikolaos Kalogeropoulos and Pierre Walker
