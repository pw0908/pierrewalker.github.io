excerpt: 'Embedding and effectively managing independent learning within engineering curricula can be somewhat challenging. This work examines the development of a student-led maker space to facilitate independent learning and explores the value that these spaces can add to engineering curricula from a student perspective. Student-led maker spaces as used here, refer to learning environments created and developed solely by students, generally outside of the university setting and with minimal faculty support, to explore concepts related to their studies. We examine the experiences of two undergraduate engineering students involved in creating a student-led maker space to develop and produce a working prototype of a 3D printed modular separation column. The results show that these spaces can provide rewarding independent learning situations that encourage entrepreneurship and promote life-long learning.'
