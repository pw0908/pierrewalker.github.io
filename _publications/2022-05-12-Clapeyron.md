excerpt: 'Equations of state are a vital tool when modelling natural gas, electrolyte, polymer, pharmaceutical and biological systems. However, their implementations have historically been abstruse and cumbersome, and as such, the only options available were black-box commercial tools. Recently, there has been a rise in open-source alternatives. Clapeyron.jl is one of the pioneering attempts at a thermodynamics framework to build and make use of equations of state. This framework is built in Julia, a modern language for scientific computing known for its ease of use, extensibility, and first-class support for differentiable programming. We currently support more equations than any package available, including standard cubic (SRK, PR, PSRK, etc.), activity-coefficient (NRTL, UNIFAC, etc.), COSMO-based, and the venerable SAFT equations. The property-estimation methods supported are extensive, including bulk, VLE, LLE and VLLE properties. With Clapeyron.jl, researchers and enthusiasts alike will be able to focus on the application and worry less about the implementation.'
